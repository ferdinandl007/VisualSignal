## How to use the app

The app functionality can be divided in 3 main steps:
1. Walk: walk around your room collecting data points about the physical space and the WiFi signal strength.
2. Visualize: with the collected data, the app will generate a 3D model of your room and 3D markers of the WiFi data on top of it, that you can visualize in 1st or 3rd person.
3. Share: capture screenshots or videos of the app, or export the 3D model of your room with the WiFi data that was collected.
